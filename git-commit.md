Git Commit
=============

git-commit - Record changes to the repository

DESCRIPTION
=============

Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.

The content to be added can be specified in several ways:

1. by using git add to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the commit command (Note: even modified files must be "added");

2. by using git rm to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before using the commit command;
